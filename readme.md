This dataset includes three unique sunflower meal (SFM) samples with variable quantities of crude protein. A 48-megapixel camera was used to capture 70 high-resolution images (6,000 x 8,000 pixels) from each sample. To preserve uniform image quality and reduce variability, the photographs were captured from multiple perspectives using controlled illumination. Each sample was placed against a uniform white backdrop to facilitate image segmentation and feature extraction. Throughout the photo sessions, effort was taken to maintain a consistent distance and angle between the camera and the samples.

Following photo acquisition, numerous image processing procedures were carried out to extract numerical features appropriate for machine learning analysis. The method began with picking the greatest square section from the raw photos, insuring the sunflower.
